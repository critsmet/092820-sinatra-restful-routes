<h2>Here are all the powers in my database!</h2>
<!-- We use the <%  %> ice cream tags when we want to run ruby code that we don't want the user to see-->
<!-- We use the <%=  %> squid tags when we want to run ruby code that we DO want the user to see, or in other words, information that lives side by side with the HTML -->
<!-- BONUS! You can use binding.pry inside of the ERB tags ğŸ¤¯ -->
